# What is Docker

> Docker is used to run software packages called containers.
> Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own
> application, tools, libraries and configuration files;
> they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.
> All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel
> and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines.
> Containers are created from images that specify their precise contents.
> Images are often created by combining and modifying standard
> images downloaded from public repositories.
